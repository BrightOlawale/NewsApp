// The html/template package is used to generate output that is safe against code injection.
// tpl is a package level variable that points to a template definition from the provided files.
// The call to template.ParseFiles parses the index.html file in the root of our project directory
// and validates it. The invocation of template.ParseFiles is wrapped with template.Must so that
// the code panics if an error is obtained while parsing the template file.

// NB: The w parameter is the structure we use to send responses to an HTTP request.
// It implements a Write() method which accepts a slice of bytes and writes
// the data to the connection as part of an HTTP response.

// The r parameter represents the HTTP request received from the client.
// Itâ€™s how we access the data sent by a client to the server.
